Assignment 2: Write a script that reads numbers from the user until they enter '0'.
 The script should also print whether each number is odd or even.


#!/bin/bash

while true
do
 echo "enter a number (0 to exit) " num
 if [ $num -eq 0 ]
 then
  echo "exiting the program"
  break
 fi

 if [ $(($num%2)) -eq 0 ]
 then 
   echo "$num is even"
 else
    echo "$num is odd"
 fi
done
